This project's purpose was to explore sorting algorithms and develop 
your own that is a combination or modification of existing ones to 
come up with the fastest way to sort a random combination of types of 
integer arrays.

My implementation uses a combination of Radix, insertion, and qsort 
depending on how the array is structured.  My algorithm does a quick
check in the beginning to see if insertion would be viable.
